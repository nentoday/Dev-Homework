## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1

- Folder: `hw1`
- Description: 6 tasks to learn basics in JavaScript

To run the homework:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `hw1` directory: `cd hw1`
3. Run the JavaScript file: `node filename.js`

Repeat a similar structure for other homework assignments, updating folder names, descriptions, and filenames accordingly.
